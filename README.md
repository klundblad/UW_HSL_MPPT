# Maximum Power Point Tracking

This is one of a slew of unfinished projects at the Husky Satellite Lab using a Buck-Boost converter IC and the AD5245 digital potentiometer to identify the maximum Voltage and maximum current periodically for a solar panel. I was able to stream data from both devices and control the wiper on the digital potentiometer, but the PCB still sits alone and lonely in the basement of the Aero-Astro department at UW.

(J1-2  to    J1-7) 
(J2-1  to    J2-1) 
(J2-14 to    J1-4) 
(J2-17 to    J1-3)
